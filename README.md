This document is basically a catch-all for general information about the Property
File handle project(Configfile).  It is anticipated that this document will be 
updated from time to time with new information.

As a developer, we all need property to per-define some variables and we can use 
it at the runtime. after some experiences in java, i get some idea to make it be
smart as show in Hogan_Configfile_Readme.pdf, showing all features of this project.

I think it's clear. and if you any concern, please let me know. and you can contact
me with below infos:
